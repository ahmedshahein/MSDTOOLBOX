The MSD-toolbox: #
##################
The Multi-Stage Decimation (MSD) toolbox consists of five packages, as follow:

1. Design
2. Implementation
3. Optimization
4. Estimation
5. Troubleshooting

The Design package is used to design and tune the overall decimation parameters, 
such as number of decimation stages (k), decimation factor at each stage (M), 
and filter length at each stage (N). However, the main advantage of the MSD is 
in the controllability and observability capabilities. The user can observe the 
in-band noise (IBN) as well as the computation effort (RT) at each stage. 
Further, the designer can choose between several filter architectures such as 
cascaded integrator comb (CIC), half-band (HB), and multi-band (MB) either 
narrow-band or wide-band.

The Implementation package is used to consider fixed point representation for 
VHDL implementation throughout quantization. The quantization bit-width (Q) 
is tuned throughout iteration process within acceptable penalty in the IBN. 
Further, it exports a VHDL top level model for RTL implementation.

The Estimation package is used to estimate power dissipation in decimation 
filter based on polyphase decimation (PPD) filter architecture only.

The Troubleshooting package is used in correlation with the VHDL models for 
troubleshooting simulation problems.

The Optimization package optimizes the fixed-point filter coefficients, 
i.e. reduces the number of non-zero terms in each coefficient. 
The optimization is achieved by polynomial programming (PP) and 
mixed integer linear programming (MILP).
